Computer vision is a process by which we can understand the images and videos how they are stored and how we can manipulate and retrieve data from them. Computer Vision is the base or mostly used for Artificial Intelligence. Computer-Vision is playing a major role in self-driving cars, robotics as well as in photo correction apps.

### OpenCV
<p align="justify">
OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human. When it integrated with various libraries, such as NumPy, python is capable of processing the OpenCV array structure for analysis. To Identify image pattern and its various features we use vector space and perform mathematical operations on these features.

###OpenCV Functionality 
 
* Image/video I/O, processing, display (core, imgproc, highgui)
* Object/feature detection (objdetect, features2d, nonfree)
* Geometry-based monocular or stereo computer vision (calib3d, stitching, videostab)
* Computational photography (photo, video, superres)
* Machine learning & clustering (ml, flann)
* CUDA acceleration (gpu)
